## Description

This code implements Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring integers. Shor's algorithm is a powerful tool for breaking the widely used RSA cryptographic system, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers.

The `shors_algorithm` function takes an integer `N` as input and returns a tuple containing the factors of `N` if they exist, or `None` if the algorithm fails to find the factors.

## Pseudo-code

The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Choose a random number `a` where `1 < a < N`.
2. Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `N`. If the GCD is greater than 1, then `a` is a factor of `N`, and the function returns the factors.
3. Find the period `r` of the function `f(x) = a^x mod N`. This is done by repeatedly squaring `a` modulo `N` until a value repeats.
4. Check if `r` is even and `a^(r/2)` is not congruent to `-1` modulo `N`. If these conditions are met, the factors of `N` can be calculated as the GCD of `(a^(r/2) + 1)` and `N`, and the GCD of `(a^(r/2) - 1)` and `N`.

## Workflow

1. The function `shors_algorithm` takes an integer `N` as input.
2. It chooses a random number `a` where `1 < a < N`. For simplicity, the code uses a fixed value of `a = 2`, but in practice, `a` should be chosen randomly.
3. The function computes the GCD of `a` and `N` using the `gcd` function from the `math` module. If the GCD is greater than 1, it means `a` is a factor of `N`, and the function returns the factors.
4. If the GCD is not greater than 1, the function proceeds to find the period `r` of the function `f(x) = a^x mod N`. This is done by repeatedly squaring `a` modulo `N` until a value repeats.
5. The function then checks if `r` is even and `a^(r/2)` is not congruent to `-1` modulo `N`. If these conditions are met, the function calculates the factors of `N` as the GCD of `(a^(r/2) + 1)` and `N`, and the GCD of `(a^(r/2) - 1)` and `N`.
6. If no factors are found, the function returns `None`.
7. The code at the end of the script tests the `shors_algorithm` function with the number `N = 21` and prints the factors if they are found, or a message indicating that the algorithm failed to find the factors.
