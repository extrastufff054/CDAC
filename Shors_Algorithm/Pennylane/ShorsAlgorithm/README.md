## Pseudo-code and Workflow

1. **Define the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) Circuit**:
   - The `qpe_circuit` function defines the quantum circuit for the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm.
   - It creates the necessary qubit registers: one for the QPE register and one for the qubits.
   - It applies the Hadamard gate to the QPE register.
   - It applies controlled-phase operations between the qubits and the QPE register.
   - It applies the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to the QPE register.
   - The function returns the QPE register.

2. **Define the Shor's Algorithm Function**:
   - The `shors_algorithm` function takes the number of qubits `n` and the target value `target` as input.
   - It calls the `qpe_circuit` function to obtain the QPE register.
   - It measures the QPE register and returns the probability distribution of the measurement results.

3. **Run the Shor's Algorithm**:
   - The code sets the number to be factored `N` to 15 and the target value `target` to 7.
   - It calculates the number of qubits required for the QPE circuit by taking the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of `N`.
   - It calls the `shors_algorithm` function with the calculated number of qubits and the target value.
   - It prints the resulting probability distribution.

## Workflow

1. The code starts by importing the necessary modules from the PennyLane library.
2. The `qpe_circuit` function is defined, which creates the quantum circuit for the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm.
   - It initializes a quantum device with the required number of qubits.
   - It creates the QPE register and the qubit registers.
   - It applies the Hadamard gate to the QPE register.
   - It applies controlled-phase operations between the qubits and the QPE register.
   - It applies the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to the QPE register.
   - It returns the QPE register.
3. The `shors_algorithm` function is defined, which implements the Shor's algorithm.
   - It calls the `qpe_circuit` function to obtain the QPE register.
   - It measures the QPE register and returns the probability distribution of the measurement results.
4. The code sets the number to be factored `N` to 15 and the target value `target` to 7.
5. It calculates the number of qubits required for the QPE circuit by taking the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of `N`.
6. It calls the `shors_algorithm` function with the calculated number of qubits and the target value.
7. It prints the resulting probability distribution.

The key steps in the Shor's algorithm implementation are:
1. Preparing the QPE circuit with the necessary qubit registers and operations.
2. Applying the controlled-phase operations to create the phase estimation.
3. Applying the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform to the QPE register.
4. Measuring the QPE register to obtain the probability distribution.

This code provides a basic implementation of Shor's algorithm using the PennyLane framework, which can be used as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation with quantum algorithms.
