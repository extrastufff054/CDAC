## Project Description
QF-Lattice is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization using Babai's algorithm and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This project aims to develop a more efficient quantum algorithm for integer factorization by combining classical lattice reduction methods with QAOA.

## How to Use
### Setup
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - Python
    ```python
    sudo apt-get install python3    #For linux

    # For Windows and Mac you can either use a package manager 
    # (like chocolatey or homebrew respectively) or download it from the official python 
    # downloads page (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
    ```
   - Qiskit
   - QAOA

2. Configure the project settings:
   - Set the number of qubits and the number of iterations for the QAOA.

### Usage
1. Run the quantum circuit using the QAOA:
   - Use the `qaoa` function to optimize the parameters of the Hamiltonian.
   - Use the `quantum_circuit` function to implement the quantum circuit.

2. Measure the quantum state to obtain the factors:
   - Use the `measurement_and_post_processing` function to measure the quantum state and post-process the results.
