# Quantum Computing Internship at C-DAC, Pune
### Repository for Internship Tasks Assigned by Mr. Amit Saxena

This repository contains the code for the quantum computing internship at C-DAC, Pune, where I worked under the guidance of Mr. Amit Saxena. The repository includes various algorithms and tasks assigned by Mr. Amit Saxena during the internship.

### Overview
The internship aimed to provide hands-on experience in quantum computing, focusing on the development of algorithms and their implementation using quantum computing frameworks. The tasks were designed to help me understand the principles and applications of quantum computing in different domains.

### Contents
- **Algorithms**:
  - Shor's Algorithm
  - Quantum Integer Factorization using Lattice Reduction
  - Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm(QAOA)
- **Tasks**:
  - Task 1: Research Paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12372)
